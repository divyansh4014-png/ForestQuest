Design a gamified productivity web application called **ForestQuest** (or a similar nature-themed title). The site should have a clean, flat design with a refreshing natural color palette (lots of greens) reflecting a forest theme. Assign each new user a unique ID to track their data. 

Create a minimal dashboard (the “ForestQuest Dashboard”) that shows the user’s avatar as a growing tree (from seedling upward) and displays key stats: level/experience, hit points (HP), and equipment or badges earned. Include a “Tasks” page where users can add, view, and complete tasks or routines with specified dates or schedules. On the Tasks page, each task should have a checkbox or button to mark it complete.

Implement game mechanics: When the user completes a task, award experience points and HP to the avatar, and unlock new equipment (icons representing achievements). The avatar’s tree should visibly grow or flourish with these rewards. If a task is missed or left incomplete by the deadline, decrement the avatar’s HP and cause the tree to regress slightly (e.g. lose some leaves, move back toward a seedling state) – do this gradually rather than resetting all at once to create a sense of stakes. Show a progress bar or visual meter for the tree’s overall growth.

Keep each page simple. For example, the Tasks page has a simple form to add tasks and a list of current tasks, and the Dashboard/profile page shows only the avatar and stats. Use friendly, motivational text (like “Your tree is growing strong!” when tasks are done, or “Complete your quest to nurture the forest!”). 

Make sure the site is responsive for mobile and desktop. Use consistent fonts and icons, minimal controls, and easily visible buttons. Include subtle animations or visual effects on success (e.g. a brief sparkle when leveling up). Encourage retention by celebrating achievements and giving clear progress feedback.

(If any design or naming details need user input, include a placeholder or prompt to clarify with the user.)
